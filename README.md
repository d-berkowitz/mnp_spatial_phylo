# mnp_spatial_phylo
Repository containing the work done for my undergraduate honors thesis on the spatial phylogenetics of vascular plants in the Mojave National Preserve. 
## There are two main data types in this project: spatial occurrence data and genetic sequence data. 
### Sequence Data
Most sequence data is from GenBank. For some taxa that whose target genes are not on GenBank, sequencing was done in the Mishler Lab on raw tissue samples collected from field surveys. 
### Spatial Occurrence Data
All spatial occurrence data were collected and recorded in analog field notebooks by the citizen science nonprofit Blueprint Earth in the Cane Spring study area in the Mojave National Preserve. These data were manually transcribed into Microsoft Excel sheets (digitized) by volunteers.

### Spatial Occurrence Data Collection
Vegetation transect data was collected by groups of volunteers equipped with local botany field guides with at least one trained scientist per group. Vegetation transects were conducted at 100m intervals, with one baseline ran for each 100m^2 section of the field area. A total of 10 individual transects were run perpendicular to the baseline at random intervals, with 10 1x1m quadrats placed at regular intervals along each transect. Therefore, a total of 100 vegetation readings were collected for each section of the field area. 
For each quadrat, the following data were collected manually in field notebooks: 
1) Ground cover type
2) Vascular plant taxa
3) \# of individuals per taxa
4) X/Y information recorded in either Latitude/Longitude or Northing/Easting with a handheld GPS, recording the point location of the quadrat
